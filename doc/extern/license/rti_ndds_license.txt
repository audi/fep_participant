    d) RTI warrants that it has the right to grant You the licenses herein.
    e) The Software provided by RTI shall be substantially in accordance with the product description and the related documentation. Your rights in case of defects shall be excluded in the case of minor or immaterial deviations from the agreed or assumed characteristics and in the case of just slight impairment of use. Product descriptions and related documentation shall not be deemed guaranteed unless separately agreed in writing. In respect of updates, upgrades and releases of new versions, Your rights in case of defects shall be limited to the new features of the update, upgrade or new version compared to the previous version release. If You demand replacement performance because of a defect, RTI has the right to choose between the improvement (Nachbesserung), replacement delivery (Ersatzlieferung) or replacement of services (Ersatzleistungen). If the defect is not cured within a first time limit and You have set RTI a reasonable second time limit without success or if a reasonable number of attempts to remedy, replacement deliveries or replacement services are unsuccessful, then You may, subject to the statutory prerequisites, at your option withdraw from this Agreement or reduce the price and claim damages or reimbursement of costs. The remedying of the defect may also take place through the delivery or installation of a new version or a work-around. If the defect does not or not substantially impair the functionality, then RTI is entitled, to the exclusion of further rights in case of defects, to remedy the defect by delivering a new version or an update as part of its version, update and upgrade planning. Defects must be notified in writing with a comprehensible description of the error symptoms, as far as possible evidenced by written recordings, hard copies or other documents demonstrating the defects. The notification of the defect should enable the reproduction of the error. This shall not affect your statutory obligation to inspect and notify defects. 
    f) Amendments or additions to the Software shall cause Your rights in case of defects to be cancelled, unless You prove that the amendment or addition did not cause the defect. RTI shall also not be responsible for defects, which are caused by improper use, improper operation or the use of unsuitable means of operation. 
    g) RTI may refuse to remedy defects or deliver replacements, until You have paid the agreed fees to RTI, less an amount which corresponds to the economic value of the defect. 
    h) The Software delivered or provided by RTI shall be free from third party rights, which prevent the use of the Software in accordance with the Agreement. If third parties are entitled to such rights and they pursue these, then RTI shall undertake reasonable efforts in order to defend the Software at its own expense against the third party rights claimed. You shall inform RTI in writing without delay of the claiming of such rights by third parties and shall give RTI all powers of attorney and authorisations which are necessary in order to defend the Software against the third party rights claimed. To the extent that there are defects in title, RTI is (i) entitled at its option to either (1) take legitimate measures to remove the third party rights, which impair the contractual use of the Software, or (2) remedy the enforcement of such claims, or (3) change or replace the Software in such a manner, that it no longer infringes the rights of third parties, provided and to the extent that this does not substantially impair the warranted functionality of the Software, and (ii) under an obligation to reimburse You for Your necessary refundable costs incurred in the enforcement of legal claims.

    f) RTI shall be liable for loss of data only up to the amount of typical recovery costs which would have arisen had proper and regular data backup measures been taken. 
    g) ANY MORE EXTENSIVE LIABILITY OF RTI IS EXCLUDED. IN PARTICULAR, YOU RECOGNIZE THAT THE SOFTWARE MAY BE PART OF A SYSTEM USED TO CONTROL EXPENSIVE OR DANGEROUS EQUIPMENT. RTI SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGE OR INJURY RESULTING FROM THE OPERATION OF SUCH EQUIPMENT. 
    h)  You agree to indemnify, defend and hold RTI harmless from any claim, lawsuit, legal proceeding, settlement or judgment (including without limitation RTI’s reasonable United States and local attorneys’ and expert witnesses’ fees and costs) arising out of or in connection with the copying, marketing, performance or other distribution of Your Target Applications. 
    i) THE LIMITED WARRANTY, LIMITED REMEDIES AND LIMITED LIABILITY SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN RTI AND YOU.  RTI WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE SOFTWARE WITHOUT SUCH LIMITATIONS.

Any software that is RTI Intellectual Property is subject to RTI’s license terms and fees.  RTI Intellectual Property delivered as stand-alone software components or plug-in modules that are first created during the Services shall be owned by RTI, but RTI grants a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, modify, sublicense and otherwise fully utilize the newly created RTI Intellectual Property without attribution.
    c) RTI warrants that it will use commercially reasonable efforts to perform the Services in a timely, professional manner.   Customer’s sole remedy, and RTI’s sole liability, for breach of this warranty is for RTI to re-perform the Services.  RTI makes no warranty that the Services will be completed to Customer’s satisfaction.  If completing the Services or bringing the Services into compliance will result in unreasonable efforts, both parties agree to negotiate in good faith to arrive at a resolution.

9. Confidentiality. RTI considers the Software to contain valuable trade secrets of RTI, the unauthorized disclosure of which could cause irreparable harm to RTI. Therefore, the NDA entered into on 09. June 2016 between Audi Electronics Venture GmbH, AUDI AG and RTI("NDA") shall apply regarding any Confidential Information as defined by the NDA. You further agree that performance, functionality or other competitive evaluation results shall not be disclosed to third parties (as defined by the NDA) without RTI’s prior written consent. 

10. Termination. This Agreement will terminate when all licenses granted hereunder have reached the end of their respective License Term unless terminated due to breach. For clarity, if the Term for any license granted is designated as "Permanent" in the LAC, then this Agreement will continue indefinitely unless terminated due to breach. In the event of a breach of this Agreement by either party, the other party may terminate this Agreement if such breach is not cured within 10 days of written notice. Upon termination, You agree not to use the Software for any purpose whatsoever and (except for reasonable backup archives) to destroy the Software and any copies then in Your possession or control, and (on request) certify in writing or via e-mail to RTI that the Software was destroyed. The remedies specified in this Agreement shall be in addition to any other remedies available to RTI.  The following provisions will survive termination of this Agreement: (a) any obligation to pay for RTI’s software or RTI services rendered before termination; (b) Sections 7 (Limitation of Liability), 11 (Confidentiality), 16 (Dispute Resolution); and (c) any other provision of this Agreement that must survive to fulfill its essential purpose.
